# Plotter
Simple dot plotting program to place dots random on java applet. They're given random power levels, and based on that they run from strong dots, or chase weaker ones. Blue dots only kill blue dots, and pink dots only kill pink dots. A dot that kills another gets a portion of that dots power.
